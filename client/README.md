# JB test task UI (Frontend)

This is the client for the Instapoke assignment.
It renders a desktop-only, Instagram-like image feed with infinite scroll, generation hashtags (e.g. #gen-iii), and lightweight virtualization for smooth scrolling over large lists.

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript (Vite)

- Redux Toolkit + RTK Query (data fetching/state)

- IntersectionObserver (custom infinite scroll hook)

- ESLint (flat config), optional Prettier

## Install deps:

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

Run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
